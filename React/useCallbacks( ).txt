useCallbacks( )
syntax :     const cachedFn =  useCallback  (  fn  , dependencies  )

useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

 "useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders" means that it's a tool provided by React to help you optimize the performance of your functional components by keeping a specific function constant (cached) unless its dependencies change, reducing unnecessary work during component re-renders.

Yes, you're absolutely right! Here's a concise summary:

    useCallback memoizes a function.
    The memoized function is recreated only when one of its dependencies changes.
    If the dependencies remain the same between renders, React reuses the previously memoized function, avoiding unnecessary recreation.

So, by specifying the dependencies in the dependency array, you control when the function should be recreated. If any of those dependencies change, the function is recreated; otherwise, React uses the memoized version. This helps in optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary renders and work.
