-> The algorithm React uses to difffrentiate one tree (virtual DOM) with another ( Browser DOM ) to determine which parts need to be changed.

-> Reconciliation is the algorithm behind virtual DOM.

- A high-level description goes something like this:   

-> when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. 
->This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment â€” for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations.
-> When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. 
->The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.


-> 2 important points :
--> 1) Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
--> 2) Diffing ( determining the differences between the previous state of the virtual DOM tree and the new state ) of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique. 



-----------  React Fiber  -------------
React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm.

->  The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. 

->  Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

-> We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

    pause work and come back to it later.
    assign priority to different types of work.
    reuse previously completed work.
    abort work if it's no longer needed

In summary:

  -> React Fiber is responsible for optimizing the rendering process, making it more incremental and efficient, and enabling features like work scheduling and prioritization.

 ->   Reconciliation is the process of comparing the previous and current states of the Virtual DOM to determine what updates are needed in the actual DOM.

->   The Virtual DOM is an abstraction that helps React optimize rendering by working with an in-memory representation of the DOM, allowing for efficient updates and minimizing the impact on the actual DOM.
